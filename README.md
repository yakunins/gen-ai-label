# Generative AI Labels

Project mission is to educate user to help build awareness about GAI products and their impact on us.  
Everyone deserves an informed choice about whether or not to consume AI-generated product.  
There's no proven method to detect share of GAI participation in project.  
Labeling relies completely on author's **honesty and conscientiousness**.
