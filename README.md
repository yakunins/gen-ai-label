# Generative AI Labels

Project mission is to help build awareness about GAI (jee-ay-eye, dʒiː-eɪ-aɪ) products and their impact. Everyone deserves an informed choice about whether or not to consume AI-generated product.

Labeling relies completely on author's **honesty and conscientiousness**, as of there's no proven method to detect share of GAI participation in project.

Explanation:

1. First three of these labels made by human.
2. Random lines in GAI label was made mostly by Generative AI.
3. Effectively, about 95% of project was made by sole human, so the project is labeled as **GAI Free**.
